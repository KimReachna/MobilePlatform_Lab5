## Laboratory Work №5

**Topic:** Interaction with the network, the server part of mobile applications.

**Requirment:**

- In Python, using the Flask framework, create a project implementing a REST API that returns JSON with a list of objects (first and last name). Objects are stored in a text file, re-read it every time you access the API.
